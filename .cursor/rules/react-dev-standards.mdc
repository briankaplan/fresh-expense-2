# React Development Standards

- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Create explicit Props interface for all components
- Keep components small and focused (<250 lines)
- Use useMemo and useCallback to optimize performance
- Extract reusable hooks for shared logic
- Separate UI components from container/logic components
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use Suspense for loading states
- Keep styling consistent with the project's approach
