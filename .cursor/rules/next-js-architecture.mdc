# NestJS Architecture Standards

- Follow NestJS module structure (controllers, services, modules)
- Use constructor dependency injection for all services
- Controllers should delegate business logic to services
- Use DTOs for all request/response data
- Implement proper validation with class-validator
- Follow proper exception handling with filters
- Use guards for authentication and authorization
- Keep controllers thin, move logic to services
- Use repositories for database operations
