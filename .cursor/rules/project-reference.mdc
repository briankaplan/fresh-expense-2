## Project References

- When referencing other projects, ensure they have `"composite": true` in their tsconfig.json
- For referenced projects that may disable emit, add `"disableSourceOfProjectReferenceRedirect": true`
- Use path mappings consistently across projects:
  ```json
  "paths": {
    "@app/*": ["apps/*/src/*"],
    "@lib/*": ["packages/*/src/*"]
  }
